Instructions for setting up github with unity

1. Download github desktop to your computer --> https://desktop.github.com/download/
2. Create a folder on your computer to save the repo to.
3. Open github desktop and in the top left select add repository, clone the '3702ICT' repository from your repos to the folder you created.
4. While in the 3702ICT repo, select branch at the top of the screen and select your branch.
5. Now in Unity Hub, instead of creating a new project, click add; find the folder you created and select the repo in the folder you just created.
6. Now, any time you make a change to the project, in github desktop you can commit and push your changes to your branch. This will save and store your changes to be later merged 
    with the changes of the other group members.
